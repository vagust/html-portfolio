    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hey there! I'm a tech enthusiast with a solid background in diverse technologies like Window Server 2012 R2,
        Linux, Active Directory, PowerShell, and more. I honed my skills in a mock call center, mastering customer
        service and remote access setup using VPN on Linux and Windows Server. In my stint at RAVENii as an IT support
        specialist, I delivered top-notch technical support through various channels. I've also tackled tech issues at
        Wholestack solutions as a help desk assistant, handling phone, email, and live chat inquiries. Beyond tech, I've
        got hands-on experience as a VPL Production Assembler, a Team Trainer at Target, and I proudly served as a
        Signal Support Systems Specialist in the US Army. Let's connect and explore how my tech and leadership journey
        can bring value to your team!</p>
